1 INTRODUCTION

1.1 History and Evolution of the C Programming

C was the offspring of the 'Basic Combined Programming Language' (BCPL) called B developed in the 1960's at Cambridge University. 
B language was modified by Dennis Ritchie and was implemented at Bell laboratories in 1972. The new language was named C. 

There are several implications to remember:

1. Every data type in C can store only a limited range of values. 
For example, the int data type cannot represent all possible integers because it has a fixed size and limited range. 
Similarly, the float data type cannot represent all real (decimal) numbers accurately due to its precision limits.

2. When using a variable of a particular data type, it is important to understand what kind of values it can hold and what operations can be performed on it.
For instance, certain operators work on the binary (bit-level) representation of integers, such as bitwise operators. 
These operators are meaningful only for integer types and cannot be applied to floating-point numbers.

3. While declaring a variable, it is necessary to choose an appropriate data type based on the values it will store and the operations that will be performed on it. 
Selecting the correct data type ensures proper functioning of the program and prevents errors or data loss.

2. FEATURES OF C AND IT BASIC STRUCTURE

Characteristic of C is that its programs are highly protable, even more so than with other high-level languages.
A C program can be viewed as a group of building  blocks called functions. 
A function is a subroutine that may include one or more statements designed to perform a specific task.
